These files are part of the caml-mode
http://caml.inria.fr/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/ocaml/trunk/emacs/

They are provided separately because
- the caml-mode is not installed as part of the ocaml installation
  (especially on windows);
- some patches may be applied to these files which are not yet present
  in the ocaml trunk.

You must install these file in a location where Emacs will find them.
Optionally, you may run "make" to byte compile them.
